<h3>Definition - SHerlin<h3>
<h4>In a world that is rapidly advancing with the use of AI and automation, the present & upcoming generations are in constant worry about their future. However, automation often creates as many jobs as it destroys. Economist David Autor suggested that there will be more labour required as there will be higher efficiency which increases public demand when automation is used. This is seen in many successful retail corporations like Amazon, that are employing both more robots and more people, resulting in a healthy balance.</h4>
<h3>Relevance - Neil<h3>
<h4>In the modern world, automation in the retail sector is quite important. AI and computers will inevitably manage the stores without any human input or assistance as technology advances quickly. In the modern era, especially with the rise of E-commerce, merchants are turning to automation to enhance customer experience, cut costs, and increase productivity.</h4>
